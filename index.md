Glodroid is a project that adapts Android Open-Source Project
to support Orange Pi platform in a way that is:

- Open and free as much as it's possible;
- Up-to-date version of Android;
- Close to mainline Android as much as it's possible;
- Provided with necessary libraries and software so user/customer
  could have up and running latest Android OS with no efforts;
